; floating point arithmetic
; heavy refactor, mostly the defered instantiation parts
; use fold expressions for _inner_ operations
; 
; Curiously Recurring Template Pattern on list class if possible
;   - replace all occurences of make_* with its factory counterpart
;       - wont this be more unreadable?
;       - make_* used on 87 lines
;       make_*() -> ListType::make 

; maybe only replace the macro part, thats the worst
