; 3.) a keyword that returns the content of the current env in scope would be nice

(
  (define (return-n-plus-two n)
   (define x 2)
   (+ n x))
) ; results in an error, the body is just (define x 2) the (+ n x) is just gone

(
  (define (return-n-plus-two n)
   (
    (define x 2)
    (+ n x)))
) ; works
